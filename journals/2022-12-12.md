Hello, my dear diary. Nice to meet you!
Yesterday I came up with the idea that writing journals in English daily may help improve my English writing skills.
With that in mind, I downloaded Grammarly and got premium to improve my English writing and learning experience. As people say, it is much easier to stick with learning if there is feedback, and thus may lead to success in education. 
I plan to stick with the plan and, more importantly, enjoy the journey of practicing my English writing skills with the help of a fantastic tool called Grammarly.
